                            I began my coding journey 10 years ago at age 10. I began learning Java by messing around with different API&apos;s for manking Minecraftâ„¢ mods.
                            While I never made anything crazy, it kickstarted my passion for coding, procedural thinking, and problem solving. I&apos;d even argue that it changed the way I view the world.
                            When I went into middle school, I took various classes that taught me HTML, CSS, and basic computer hardware. 

                            Throughout highschool I learned C# with Unity in my Game Programming classes, and I more formally learned the Java programming language in traditional computer science classes.
                            In my free time I also learned Python3 while learning basic data structures and algorithms (Linked Lists, BST, Hashes, Divide and Conquer Techniques, etc.)

                            The summer before my freshman year, I learned C++ because I heard that was the language primarily taught at the school I was going to.
                            This is where a massive gap in my knowledge became filled related to computer memory and pointers. I found C++ to be much more enjoyable and useful than Java.
                            My freshman year was a breeze after having spent the summer learning C++, there were no new concepts that I hadn&apos;t learned on my own. I was fortunate enough to have gotten
                            an internship this summer, and I learned a lot of database concepts working with some of the big Oracle guys at Viscosity NA. Also during that summer
                            I learned the Rust language in my free time, as I found the ownership system in the language to be an interesting method of handling memory.

                            When I came into college, I was still limited in perception of the computer science world. All I knew was there were
                            a bunch of different programming languages that each had their benefits. After my internship, I had learned to think
                            in terms of frameworks and architecture rather than programming languages. From here on out, instead of broadening my knowledge
                            by &quot;learning a new programming language,&quot; instead I would learn a new architecture, concept, or framework.

                            In my sophmore year, I decided to begin a personal project called the Nich Neuron. While I didn&apos;t complete the project,
                            the concepts I learned along the way was invaluable. Most notably marshalling and
                            unmarshalling JSON files, REST, and back-end frameworks. The back-end framework I learned was <a href="https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin" target="_blank" className=" font-bold underline">Gin</a> written for Golang, a language I acquired a strong taste for at the end of my &quot;Language Learning Arc.&quot;

                            I am now a Junior, and this year I&apos;ve been focusing on creating several projects with my accumulated knowledge over the years. I&apos;ve found with time that I enjoy and gravitate towards web development, and I am excited to create more web development related projects this year. Some of the tools I&apos;ve become much more familiar with this
                
                            year have been AWS, Postgres, React, Next, Golang, and C.
