    <p>I've cut massive amounts of weight 4x in my life, and I managed it differently each time. The first time I lost 50lbs in about 4 months, years later I lost 75lbs in 6 months, my last diet was 30lbs over 6 months, and I am about 3 months into my current diet.
        Because of this, I genuinely think my story helps explain what not to do as well as some things that help a lot when it comes to weight loss.

    <p>
        I'll highlight
        the most relevant information and the lifestyle changes that were actually needed. Many people think cutting weight is about eating all the
        foods you don't like, starving yourself, and running all the time. In reality, while there are certain elements of that in dieting down, there 
        is an art to it such that it can be enjoyable and sustainable. While I've cut big weight a number of times, I'd argue I haven't done it right almost a single time. And I'll get more into what that means later, first, I want to make some clear points of what NOT to do. Trust me, I've been there.

    <h4 style="font-size: larger; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px">Starvation</h4>
    <p>Throughout my life I've always struggled with my weight. When I was 14, I had high cholesterol and high tryglycerides
        which are associated with an increased risk of heart disease by contributing to the hardening of arteries. At that time I knew nothing about food,
        and I was extremely insecure and afraid for my health at a young age. I didn't understand the lifestyle changes I needed to make or how they helped,
        and I felt extremely embarassed being the only person under 40 at the heart doctor. It didn't help that my parents didn't change the foods I was eating to any meaningful extent. I was one of the fattest kids in my grade, and it slaughtered my self esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
        I finally had enough, and decided over the summer going into 10th grade that I would essentially stop eating. I told my mom that I wanted to be 
        responsible for my food, then I only had 10 microwavable chicken nuggets a day for the rest of the summer. Looking at the food label now, that means every day I had 420 calories, 26g
        of fat, 24g of carbs, and 22g of protein. When I asked ChatGPT how much a 14 year old boy my height should be eating, it said 2600-3000 calories a day, with 130-180g of protein,
        70-100g of fats, and 300-400g of carbs. Now I'd argue this is maybe on the higher end, but for a growing boy it makes sense.
    </p>
    <p>The result was that I lost a good amount of weight while being chrnoically exhausted and hungry, and I continued this trend going into the school year. I began eating lunch at school as well as breakfast,
        and this is where things took a turn. I started to feel guilt any time I ate. If I ever ate something, I made sure to promise myself I would burn it off later, or would
        eat less in the next meal or the next day. I decided to add cardio to the mix to help offset these extra calories coming in. Since I was still extremely
        insecure of how much fat I was carrying, I decided to do my cardio at night so people wouldn't see me running.
